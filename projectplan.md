## Gap Analysis vs PRD Requirements

### Phase 1 MVP Requirements (Missing)
1. **Database persistence** - Currently everything is in-memory only
2. **Customer CRUD operations** - Only read operation exists
3. **Authentication system** - No user management
4. **Basic analytics** - No KPI calculations
5. **Invoice generation** - Completely missing
6. **Data validation** - Only client-side validation

### High Priority Gaps
1. **Data Persistence**: App is unusable without database connection
2. **Authentication**: Required for multi-user support
3. **Customer Management**: Core feature for consultant workflow
4. **Invoice Generation**: Critical business functionality
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Essential for business insights

### Medium Priority Gaps
1. **Agreement Management**: Important for contract-based work
2. **Advanced Time Entry Features**: Bulk operations, templates
3. **Email Integration**: For sending invoices
4. **Export Capabilities**: Data portability

### Low Priority Gaps
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Complex visualizations
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Desktop-first approach acceptable
3. **Offline Support**: Nice to have but not essential
4. **Dark Mode**: Cosmetic enhancement

## Priority Development Areas

### Immediate (Phase 1) - Core MVP
1. **Database Setup & Integration**
   - Set up Supabase database with proper schema
   - Implement API routes for CRUD operations
   - Connect frontend to backend APIs
   - Add proper error handling

2. **Authentication System**
   - Implement Supabase Auth
   - Add login/signup pages
   - Protect routes with authentication
   - User profile management

3. **Customer Management**
   - Customer creation/editing forms
   - Customer deletion with safeguards
   - Proper validation and error handling
   - Customer profile enhancements

4. **Time Entry Persistence**
   - Save time entries to database
   - Load entries from database
   - Real-time updates
   - Proper validation

### Next Priority (Phase 2)
1. **Basic Analytics Dashboard**
   - Total hours calculation
   - Revenue tracking
   - Active clients count
   - Basic KPIs

2. **Invoice Generation (Basic)**
   - Simple invoice creation

## Technical Debt & Issues

1. **Type Safety**: Some TypeScript types need refinement
2. **Error Handling**: No global error boundary or proper error states
3. **Loading States**: No loading indicators throughout the app
4. **Form Validation**: Could be more comprehensive
5. **Code Organization**: Some components could be broken down further
6. **Testing**: No test coverage currently
7. **Documentation**: Limited inline documentation
8. **Performance**: No optimization for large datasets

## Conclusion

The current time-tracker app has a solid foundation with a working calendar interface and basic time entry functionality. However, it's missing critical backend infrastructure and persistence layer, making it essentially a demo/prototype rather than a production-ready application.

The immediate focus should be on implementing data persistence and authentication to make the app actually usable, followed by expanding the customer management capabilities and adding basic analytics and invoicing features to complete the MVP.
